These powerful frameworks serve different purposes. Here’s a quick comparison to guide your decision:\n\nLangGraph:\n\n- Structured workflows at its core.\n- Ideal for visualizing and managing complex AI task pipelines.\n- Uses a graph-based approach, perfect for workflows where task sequence and dependencies matter.\n\nLangChain:\n\n- Built for developers prioritizing flexibility.\n- Enables programmatic chaining of LLM tasks, supporting dynamic workflows.\n- Best for experimentation, prototyping, and quickly integrating AI functionalities into applications.\n\nWhich Should You Choose?\n\n- Opt for LangGraph if your project demands complex workflows with clear dependencies.\n- Choose LangChain for a code-first approach that allows you to chain AI tasks flexibly.\n\nUnderstanding these differences can save you time and align your tools with your project goals effectively. AI development isn’t just about building—it’s about building smart.\n\nWhich framework do you prefer and why? Share your insights below and let’s discuss!",

    "post": "Day 10: Practical Demo -> Assembling and Evaluating a RAG Application\n\nToday, I took the first step into a hands-on demo for assembling and evaluating a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application.\n\nThe focus was on setting up and testing the retrieval component using LangChain in Databricks. This is the backbone of any RAG pipeline, and it was interesting to see it in action! 🚀\n\nSummary of today:\n\n1️⃣ Demo Overview\nThe goal was to assemble the RAG components and demonstrate their interaction.\n\nWorkflow:\n- A user asks a question.\n- The system retrieves relevant documents using the Vector Search Index.\n- Context is added to the prompt and passed to the foundation model endpoint.\n- The final answer is displayed to the user.\n\n2️⃣ Setting Up the RAG Components\nRetriever: Configured the Vector Search Endpoint as a retriever to identify top relevant documents for any query.\n\nSteps to implement:\n- Defined the endpoint using LangChain.\n- Tested the LangChain embedding model to ensure compatibility.\n- Set up and validated the retriever function.\n\n3️⃣ LangChain in Action\nEmbedding Model: Used the Databricks bge-large-en embedding model for consistent results.\n\nKey Code Highlights:\n- Created a retriever function with k=2 to fetch the top two relevant documents.\n- Successfully invoked the retriever to answer the query: \"How does Generative AI impact humans?\"\n- Outputs: Relevant documents with context-rich responses.\n\n💡 Key Learnings\n\n- LangChain Integration: Seamless integration with Databricks enhances the ability to build robust RAG pipelines.\n- Efficient Retrieval: Properly setting up the retriever ensures accurate and contextually relevant document retrieval.\n- Modular Design: Breaking down the process into components (retrieval, context addition, model query) simplifies debugging and scalability.\n\n#databrickslearningfestival #rag #retrievalaugmentedgeneration #langchain #generativeai #databricks",
